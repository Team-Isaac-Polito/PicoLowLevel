# PicoLowLevel

This is the code running on the board inside each module of **Rese.Q**.

## üì¶ Module Components

Each module includes the following components:

- **Raspberry Pi Pico W**
- **CAN transceiver**, with **MCP2515** and **TJA1050**
- **Two DC motors**, featuring:
  - **Pololu G2 24v13** driver
  - **Rotary encoder** with **48 pulses per motor rotation**
  - **150:1 gearbox**
- **One to three Dynamixel AX-12A smart servo motors**
- **AMS AS5048B absolute encoder**
- **64√ó128 OLED display**, with **SH1106 driver**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Project

To build the project, you need a working Arduino environment. You can use:

- The **official Arduino IDE**
- **VSCode**, with the [Arduino extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-arduino)
- Or simply **[arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli)**

### üìå Arduino-Pico

This project is based on the Arduino framework and specifically uses the **Raspberry Pi Pico core**, available [here](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico). You can follow the installation guide in the repository's README.

### üìö Required Libraries

Currently, the only external library used is:

- `Adafruit SH110X` ‚Üí for controlling the OLED display

It can be installed via the Arduino Library Manager.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build Options

In the **Arduino IDE**, select:

- **Board:** Raspberry Pi Pico W
- **Flash Size:** `2MB (Sketch: 1MB, FS: 1MB)`
  - **1MB** for the program code
  - **1MB** for data storage and OTA updates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Using the Makefile

üîπ **Before executing any Makefile command, ensure you have installed `arduino-cli`.**


#### 1. Download Arduino CLI
- Go to the official release page:
  üîó [Arduino CLI Releases](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/releases)
- Download the **ZIP file** for Windows (e.g., `arduino-cli_latest_Windows_64bit.zip`).
- Extract the contents to a folder, such as `C:\arduino-cli`.

---

#### 2. Add Arduino CLI to the System PATH (Optional, but Recommended)
If you want to use `arduino-cli` from any directory, add it to the **system PATH**:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press `Enter`.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab ‚Üí click **Environment Variables**.
3. In the **System Variables** section, find `Path` and click **Edit**.
4. Click **New** and enter the path to the folder where you extracted Arduino CLI (e.g., `C:\arduino-cli`).
5. Click **OK** to save the changes.

---

####  3. Verify the Installation
Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and type:
```bash
arduino-cli version
```


Before using the Makefile, ensure that you have installed the correct rp2040 core. You can do this by running the following command in your command prompt:

```bash
arduino-cli config init
arduino-cli core update-index
arduino-cli core install rp2040:rp2040@4.5.0
```

Additionally, to run the Makefile on Windows, you need to install MinGW-w64. MinGW-w64 provides a complete toolchain including the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and other essential tools for compiling code on Windows. You can download it from the official [ MinGW-w64 website](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases).

Once downloaded, add the folder
`C:\...\mingw64\bin`
to your environment variables as a new PATH entry.


Next, you need to install GnuWin32 Make from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/). After installing, add the binary folder:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin`

to your PATH.

Then restart the PC


To verify that the installation of MinGW-w64 was successful, open a new command prompt and type:

```bash
gcc --version
```

To verify that the installation of GnuWin32 was successful, open a new command prompt and run:

```bash
make --version
```
